1. Add comments:
   Explanation: Adding comments will improve code readability and maintainability.
   Location: Above the class and method declarations.
   Before:
   ```java
   public class Person {
       // ...
   }
   ```
   After:
   ```java
   /**
    * Represents a person with a name and age.
    */
   public class Person {
       // ...

       /**
        * Constructs a Person object with the given name and age.
        *
        * @param name the name of the person
        * @param age the age of the person
        */
       public Person(String name, int age) {
           // ...
       }

       // Add similar comments for other methods
   }
   ```

2. Validate age input:
   Explanation: It's a good practice to validate user input, especially for fields that have specific constraints (e.g., age should be a positive integer).
   Location: Inside the `setAge` method.
   Before:
   ```java
   public void setAge(int age) {
       this.age = age;
   }
   ```
   After:
   ```java
   public void setAge(int age) {
       if (age < 0) {
           throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age cannot be negative");
       }
       this.age = age;
   }
   ```
